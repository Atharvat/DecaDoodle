# DecaDoodle: Gen AI powered comic strip generator

![DecaDoodle](screenshot1.png)

DecaDoodle is a web app that generates 10 panel comic strips from given text inputs for each panel. 
You can also download the generated comic strip as a png image.
More features coming soon!

This project is a part of an assignment for [Dashtoon](
https://www.dashtoon.com/)'s recruitment process.

Note: I am using random images from unsplash as the provided API doesn't seem to be working.
